    <p>NICE labs is located on the 4th floor in SIST‘s NO.1 Building: 图</p>
    <p>We look forward to seeing you!</p>
    <p>Considering the research capabilities we already have and the possible expansion in the future, we will focus on four key breakthroughs in the following four subareas of Network Science research:</p>
    <p>· Network communications: including network information theory, network coding theory, network optimization, network economics, wireless network, Internet of Things, data center network and cloud computing;</p>
    <p>· Network security: network security based on the theory of network information and quantum information;</p>
    <p>· Network storage: cloud storage , cache-centric information central network;</p>
    <p>· Network information processing: signal (information) processing based on the pictures, social networking and massive information analysis.</p>
    <p>In order to achieve the above objectives, NICE plans to build the three experimental system platform in the following five years:</p>
    <p>- Massive MIMO communication signal processing platform </p>
    <p>- Heterogeneous network communication platform </p>
    <p>- Data Center Network Experimental Platform</p>
